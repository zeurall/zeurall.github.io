abstract: Many properties of perceptual decision making are well-modeled by deep neural
  networks. However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous
  readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present
  an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response
  times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking
  activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations
  of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent
  homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers
  an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity.
  Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled
  and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial
  patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the
  model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including
  stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling
  of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy
  trade-offs.
