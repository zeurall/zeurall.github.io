            <h2 id="thor-the-mighty-god-of-thunder">Thor: The Mighty God of Thunder</h2>

<p>Thor, one of the most prominent and revered figures in Norse mythology, is the god of thunder, lightning, storms, oak trees, strength, and the protection of mankind. As the son of Odin, the All-Father, and Jörð, the personification of the Earth, Thor is the strongest of all the Æsir gods and serves as the primary champion of Asgard. His tales are filled with heroic deeds, colossal battles, and an unwavering commitment to defending the realms of gods and mortals from the destructive forces of chaos, primarily the jötnar (giants).</p>

<p>Unlike his father, Odin, who often relies on cunning, magic, and intellectual pursuits, Thor is a god of action. He is known for his straightforward, courageous, and sometimes hot-headed nature. He possesses a formidable physical presence, typically depicted with a powerful build and a fiery red beard that crackles with lightning. He travels across the sky in a chariot pulled by two giant goats, Tanngrisnir (Teeth-barer) and Tanngnjóstr (Teeth-grinder), and the rumbling of his chariot wheels is said to be the source of thunder.</p>

<p>Thor’s power is amplified by three magical artifacts. The most famous is his hammer, Mjölnir, a fearsome weapon forged by the dwarven brothers Sindri and Brokkr. Mjölnir is capable of leveling mountains with a single blow and, when thrown, it always returns to Thor’s hand. To wield the hammer, Thor requires a pair of iron gauntlets, Járngreipr, which allow him to handle its immense power. He also wears a belt of strength, Megingjörð, which is said to double his already incredible might. Together, these items make him nearly invincible in battle.</p>

<p>Thor’s primary antagonists are the giants of Jötunheimr, who represent the forces of chaos and nature that constantly threaten the order of the cosmos. His sagas are replete with accounts of his journeys into their land to thwart their schemes. One of the most famous stories involves a visit to the castle of the giant king Útgarða-Loki, where Thor and his companions are subjected to a series of deceptive tests. Thor is challenged to lift a giant cat, which is actually the Midgard Serpent, Jörmungandr, in disguise; he is challenged to a drinking contest from a horn that is connected to the sea; and he is asked to wrestle an old woman who is the personification of old age. Though he technically “fails” these tasks, his efforts are so immense—lifting the serpent enough to make it let go of its own tail, drinking a significant portion of the ocean, and holding his own against old age—that he terrifies Útgarða-Loki and proves his unmatched power.</p>

<p>He is the husband of the golden-haired goddess Sif, and together they have a daughter named Þrúðr. He also has two sons, Móði (Courage) and Magni (Might), with the giantess Járnsaxa. His family life, though not as central to his myths as his battles, highlights his role as a protector and a figure of stability. Thor’s hall in Asgard is named Bilskírnir, the largest of all the buildings in the celestial realm, with 540 rooms. It is a fitting home for the great defender of both gods and humanity. At Ragnarök, the prophesied end of the world, Thor is destined to finally kill his arch-nemesis, the Midgard Serpent, but he will succumb to the serpent’s venom and die shortly after, a testament to his eternal, self-sacrificing role as a guardian of the realms.</p>
