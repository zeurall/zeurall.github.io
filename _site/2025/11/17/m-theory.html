<p>M-Theory represents a bold attempt to unify all fundamental forces of nature into a single framework. It extends string theory by introducing higher-dimensional objects called branes, potentially explaining the fabric of the universe.</p>

<p>Although still theoretical, M-Theory has profound implications for understanding black holes, quantum gravity, and the origin of the cosmos. Physicists continue to explore its complex mathematics and connections to observable phenomena.</p>
